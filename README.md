# Pipeline for digital scholarly editions

## What is the pipeline for digital scholarly editions?
Born from the DAHN project, a technological and scientific collaboration between Inria, Le Mans Université and EHESS, and funded by the French Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation (more information on this project can be found [here](https://github.com/FloChiff/DAHNProject)), the pipeline aims at reaching the following goal: facilitate the digitization of data extracted from archival collections, and their dissemination to the public in the form of digital documents in various formats and/or as an online edition.  
This pipeline has been created by [Floriane Chiffoleau](https://cv.archives-ouvertes.fr/floriane-chiffoleau), under the supervision of [Anne Baillot](https://cv.archives-ouvertes.fr/annebaillot) and [Laurent Romary](https://cv.archives-ouvertes.fr/laurentromary), and with the help of [Alix Chagué](https://cv.archives-ouvertes.fr/alix-chague) and [Manon Ovide](https://github.com/inoblivionem).
